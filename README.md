# My test file
## Creator: Quang Cuong


I try to create a readme file:
> This is my first file

**_I will write hello world code in python_**
```
my_string = "Hello world"
print(my_string)

```

There are some things I need to remember:
1. First I must write readme.md for each project
2. When commit something, I must write message
3. I should create a changelog file when I want change somethings
4. Forget all these above
